# Vroom
The app that keeps your car running!

## Design Phase
Design of Vroom is being done in Sketch and exported to this github for easy access throughout the team. 
Please pull the repository's design branch and reference the exports/assets folders for completed designs.
If you wish to collaborate a trial or license of Sketch is necessary to do so.

Animations are being completed in AfterEffect using the BodyMovin plugin in conjunction with Lottie React Native by Airbnb. An active license of Adobe Create Cloud is necessary to work on these files.
